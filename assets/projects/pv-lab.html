        As there exists many different applications as well as due to the demand of higher efficiency, various solar
        cell types have been developed. Significantly, the crystalline silicon solar cells with the most popular and
        utilized variations of them being the monocrystalline and multicrystalline solar cell. An experiment was made to
        study the characteristics of such cells, as well as study their characteristics by mimicking real life
        conditions by studying the effect of a bypass diode on a module of the aforementioned solar cell types.
        Measurements were made, results were recorded and IV curves at different scenarios were plotted to show such
        effects.
